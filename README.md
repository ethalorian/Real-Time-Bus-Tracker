# Map Animation Project

## Description

This project demonstrates a simple map animation using Mapbox GL JS. It plots a series of bus stops between MIT and Harvard on a map and animates a marker along the route. The animation is triggered by a button click.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to start the animation.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

- [ ] Add the API from the MBTA to track the busses in real time.
- [ ] Add custom Icons for the busses and stops.
- [ ] Allow users to select different routes.
